        // Which part of the arrays module was most challenging for you?
        // The most difficult part was reversing an array manually,
        // since it required understanding how to swap elements and
        // why the loop only runs up to half of the array.

        // What debugging habit helped you the most?
        // I learned try catch this time, it's good.

        // How can you apply arrays in your next project or course?
        // I think finding the maximum, minimum, average, calculating sums,
        // and sorting arrays are all very important skills.
        // They help me organize and analyze data efficiently.

        // Thank you for your minibook. I find it very useful.
        // Because it covers everything from basic to advanced topics.
        // The explanations and comments help me think deeply.
        // For example, when I read the sentence “A strong debugging mindset saves more time than memorizing syntax”,"Remind students: design first, code second."
        // I can feel that you genuinely want us to learn, and I really appreciate how dedicated you are.
